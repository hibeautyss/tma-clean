++ When i create a new dashboard it already store information about previous creation
++ When you create a poll and choose time its looking bad (copy from rally and from edit section)
++ Need to save changes of "edit details"
++ Save changes of "edit options"
++ "Place" is missing in the poll after creation
++ UI button is broken when you create a poll and add time
When i join the poll ic reated via code, not via "my polls" i cant manage it
